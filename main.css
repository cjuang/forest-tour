                <p> If you need real-time weather data, the Fisher Meteorological Station has been recording data since 2001. Its predecessor, the Shaler Meteorological Station, recorded data from 1964 to 2002. The two stations were run concurrently for 18 months to make corrections for the transition from one meteorological station to another.</p> 
                <p>Data from these two Meteorological Stations at Harvard Forest have shown that temperature has increased by 0.17 degrees Fahrenheit per decade since measurements were first started. <b>That means as of 2014, temperature has increased 0.83 degrees Fahrenheit, almost a whole degree!</b></p>

                <p>The Raup House was a 1948 gift of Ernest Stillman, a medical scientist at Rockefeller University and philanthropist who earlier had supported the building of Shaler Hall and the Fisher Museum.</p>

                <br><h4>Standing Since the Beginning of Harvard Forest</h4>
                <p>The Fisher House is named after <b>Richard Thornton Fisher</b> (1876-1934), the first director of Harvard Forest (1907-1934) and a professor at the Harvard Business School. The house was likely built around the time of Fisher's marriage to Georgina Paine in 1913.</p><br> 
                <h4>Fisher and his Dioramas</h4>
                <p>Richard T. Fisher is best known for the dioramas in the Fisher Museum, which were part of the Director's plan to create a forestry museum open to the public. According to Al C. Cline (Director of Harvard Forest 1938 to 1946), <br><q>The prospect of such a unique and eminently useful gift [referring to the dioramas and the museum] appealed deeply to Professor Fisher, the more so because of his strong belief in the value of visual aids to instruction, and he entered wholeheartedly into the exacting task of designing the models and instructing the artists in the minutiae of tree and stand structure.</q></p>

                <p> These rocks didn't stack themselves! This is a piece of the original cropland border within Jonathan and Molly Sanderson's 50-acre farm (est. 1763). It is estimated that the Sanderson Family built more than 1.5 miles of stone wall throughout their property. The stones were dug up from the soil, one by one, to create boundary fences and to clear the land for crops and pasture. Stone walls like these can be found all over Harvard Forest and New England as a remnant of its colonial and agricultural past. The stones themselves originated from glaciers, dropped into the ground as the glacier retreated.</p>

                <p><b>The original Sanderson Farmhouse</b>, now called Community House, still stands at Harvard Forest. The house's front door once faced Main Street. As you walk the first seven Stops in the French Road Trail, you are walking on the original Main Street between Athol and Petersham before the road was relocated (as Rte. 32) to make it easier for wheeled vehicles and carts to drive. After the Sanderson Family sold the farm in 1845, the land passed through farm ownerships until it was owned by a religious communal group, the Adonai Shomo (also known as the Fullerite Community), in 1876 until 1897.</p>

                <hr><br><h4>Who was Jonathan Sanderson?</h4>
                <p>Jonathan Sanderson (1740-1832) was a respected farmer and figure in Petersham and Worcester County. His account book, which is kept in the Harvard Archives, details that he ran a store during the Revolutionary War in the 18th century. Some of the items he sold were sugar, window glass, shoes and shoe-buckles, silk, molasses, calico, nails, raisins, and malt. In 1763, he began to clear the land for his farm. He married Molly Curtis in 1768 and had six children between 1769 and 1785. Records show Sanderson established a tannery on the farm in 1814. By 1830, Sanderson could deliver his produce to the market in Petersham thanks to the road network that had developed. Sanderson lived for over ninety years.</p>

                <hr><br><h4>Food For Thought: Sugar Maple Research</h4>
                <p>On this part of the trail, sugar maples line both sides of the path. Sugar maples were planted on the Sanderson farm during the 19th century to produce maple syrup. Planting trees along the road made it easier to collect and transport buckets full of sap in the late winter snow.</p>
                <p>Today, researchers at Harvard Forest study these sugar maple trees to understand how the trees use and store energy throughout the year.</p>
                <br><h4>Sap Sugar and Mast Seeding</h4>
                <p>When plants produce large quantities of fruits or seeds, it is called masting or mass seeding. In sugar maples, this typically happens every three to five years. Harvard Forest research has shown that if a sugar maple produces a high number of seeds in a mast year in autumn, there will be less sugar in its sap the following spring.</p>

                <br><h4>A Pool for Plants</h4>
                <p>The former pool is a great model of <b>old field succession</b>, ecological succession in an abandoned area that was once modified by human activity. After the pool was filled in with soil in the late 1900s, it first grew pioneer wetland species. As soil conditions have changed over time, grasses and herbs like the perennial herb goldenrod (<i>Solidago spp.</i>) have replaced the pioneer species.</p>
                <p>As you walk the trail, compare the types of plants that grow in the former pool to the lawn surrounding the pool and the pasture and forest beyond. All three areas are former farmland that once belonged to the Sanderson Family, but continued human activities on each site have changed the modern-day plant communities that grow there.</p>

                    <p>The most common tree of the red oak group in Harvard Forest is the red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>). Other members of the Red Oak group include scarlet oak (<i>Quercus coccinea</i>), pin oak (<i>Quercus palustris</i>), and black oak (<i>Quercus velutina</i>). The leaves of trees within the red oak group all have pointed ends, and are difficult to distinguish. However, their acorns are distinctive in size and shape.
                    <p>In the winter, you can often identify red oak by its bark, which usually includes some reddish coloration in the furrows of the bark, as well as an alternating light and dark pattern (light on the ridges, dark in the valleys) that may resemble ski slopes.</p>

                    <p>White pine needles always have 5 needles in a bundle (To remember this: there are five letters in the word "white").</p>
                    <p>White pine trees are usually the tallest trees in the area, because they are very shade-intolerant and grow fast to gather as much sunlight as possible. They can grow upwards of 150 feet, about as tall as a 13-story building.</p>

                    <p>RThe leaves on trees in the red oak group are differently-sized, even on the same tree. Red oak group leaves in the canopy (at the top of the tree) have larger sinuses (the spaces between lobes on a leaf)--like Leaf 3--in order to minimize surface area and transpiration. Red oak group leaves with smaller sinuses--like Leaf 5--maximize surface area and the absorption of sunlight for photosynthesis.</p>

                    <p>Red maple leaves have only three lobes, which makes them easy to distinguish from five-lobed sugar maple leaves. The edge of the red maple leaf is serrated with irregularly-sized teeth, and the leaf size is smaller than most other maple species.</p>

                <hr><br><h4>What Controls Leaf Color?</h4>
                <p>Leaf color is driven by pigments inside the leaf, weather, and the type of tree. Chlorophylls that carry out the process of photosynthesis in plant chloroplasts give leaves their green color. Carotenoids produced in plant plastids reflect yellow light. Anthocyanins produced in the cytoplasm during a specific chemical reaction reflect red light. </p>
                <p>As the growing season nears its end in the fall, trees speed up the process of breaking down chlorophyll and transporting it out of their leaves in preparation for the winter. Without chlorophyll to absorb all light except green light, the colors of carotenoids and anthocyanins show through.</p>

                <br><h4>The Footprint of a Forest Disturbance</h4>
                <p>A <b>disturbance</b> is a sudden change in an ecosystem.</p>
                <p>Powerful winds from a microburst strom in 2014 felled many trees at Harvard Forest. Over time, fallen trees will decay and become small mounds and dips on the forest floor. It's possible to tell the direction of the wind based on the direction that the trees fell and the shape of the mounds left by their roots.</p>
                <h4>How to Search for Past Human Activity</h4>
                <p>Humans can also cause ecosystem disturbance. How can you tell if a forest landscape has been modified by humans? One way is to look for stonework (evidence of colonial agriculture) or the presence of cut stumps (evidence of past logging). Another way is to look for old trees lying on the forest floor; in managed forests, often there are relatively few trees left to decay.</p>

                <br><h4>Watch Out for Moose and Deer</h4>
                <p>Harvard students planted red pine stand (called a <p>plantation</p>) here in the 1920s. The plantation was harvested in 2008 to help native forest tree species to regenerate. Now Harvard Forest researchers are studying how moose and deer shape the regenerating tree community in a long-term research project. By using fence exclosures, researchers can limit which types of animals can pass through to browse the saplings. By comparing the list of saplings growing within the fences--where moose and deer cannot reach--to plants outside the fences, they learn how different animals affect the plant communities in recently logged areas.</p>

                <h4>Caught on Camera</h4>
                <p>A regrowing forest brings in many hooved guests. Moose and deer are attracted to disturbed and regenerating forests, because young tree saplings are easy to reach and eat. In order to monitor the activities of moose, deer, and other wildlife that pass through the exclosure, ecologist Ed Faison and research assistant Greta VanScoy mounted flashless digital game cameras around the area to track animal visitors.</p>

                <br><h4>Room at the French Road Inn</h4>
                <p>The French Road Inn was a prosperous farmhouse built in 1764 by Elisha Ward, brother of Artemas Ward, the first commander-in-chief of the American Revolution. It was conveniently situated next to the former Main Street that ran between Petersham and Athol.  The Ward farm property included two barns and a small pasture for holding animals directly in front of the house. By the 1780s, it had become an Inn for stagecoaches to stop through as they traveled from Boston. The Ward Family sold the property to the Sweetser Family in 1836. The property, about 250 acres in area, was sold at an auction to Almond French in 1848.</p> <p>Between the Ward Family and French Family ownership over the property, the Inn was transformed from a tavern back into a farmhouse. The central chimney, which had four fireplaces on the first floor and a large brick oven in one of the house's rooms, was removed and a smaller chimney was constructed in its place.</p>

                    <p><q><i>The next place on the old road is the French place, occupied by the French family for many years. It was known earlier as the Ward place. The Ward family moved to Montague, where the descendants still live. It was next called the Col. Sweetzer place. (Before that, when the Wards lived there, it was a tavern, according to Mrs. Battersby.) After Mr. Sweetser, William Mann lived there a while. Then Timothy French and his son Almond moved there. They were the first of my recollection. It has been occupied by some of their descendants until recent years. I believe it is now owned by the estate of the late William P. Bennett. (Owned by Mrs. R. T. Fisher, 1935.) Almond French was twice married. There were three or four daughters by the first marriage. There is but one living, Mrs. Ellen Drury of Athol, whose husband, George W. Drury, died last summer. Mr. French’s second wife was Lucy Ball. There were two sons and I think two daughters by this union. One son, William Almond French, lives on Long Island, N.Y. and the other, Fred, in Athol. The girls died young. [(unoccupied, 1935)]</i></q></p>

As it is very doubtful that I can come over there at that time I will tell you in this letter of a few things that I know and have heard about the place on Bennet Hill where I was born and lived for 30 years. Also a picture I had taken while I was on the place, but it has faded out somewhat by the 40 years or more since it was taken. The picture was taken after the old chimney had been taken out, and a much smaller one put in its place. The original chimney was very large. It had 4 large fireplaces on the first floor and a large brick overn in one of the rooms. The timbers of the house were The rafters on the backside of the house were very long and large. The doors had one panel in top and bottom made of very wide boards and the latches were handmade. I was told the place used to be one where the stagecoaches stopped in the old days when they were going through from Boston. There was a large barn and granary on the place built of large hewed timbers. I was told that a man named as I remember it as Switcher [Sweetser] who kept many fat oxen in the large barn at one time. The house was 2 stories in front and one in the back. I notice the picture is so faded out you can hardly see it. <br><br>From Wm. A. French</p></i>

                    <p><q><i>The next farm on the rise going up Bennett Hill and after passing Mr. Lehman's house is the one belonging to the French family. Seventy years and more it belonged to a wealthy resident by the name of Henry Ward, whose father was Elisha formerly of Shrewsbury. This Ward married a sister of John Sanderson, Sr., his neighbor. They had two sons. John Ward, who resided at Montague and died many years ago, he had a son who died young. Also two or three daughters who resided at Montague. This Henry Ward was one time a merchant in Shutesbury, was a very shrewd business man. He lost goods by thieves and set a trap to catch them and really broke up the gang. He went to the Governor and told them to he was going to join the gang of thieves to try and bring them to trial. He did so and went around with them and the same time finding some of his goods. After he came out and had them convicted he was in fear of his life ever after.</i></q></p>

                <p>The French Road Inn property had two large barns on it. Stone borders on the grass mark outlines and interior walls of these barns.</p>
                <p>William French writes in a letter to Mabel Coolidge in 1935,</p>
                <p><q><i>There was a large barn and granary on the place built of large hewed timbers. I was told that a man named as I remember it Switcher [Sweetser] who kept many fat oxen in the large barn at one time.</i></q></p>

                <h4>Trees Know How to Grow</h4>
                <p>This bent tree did not let a disruption stop it from growing upwards. The tree is experiencing a <b>tropism</b>, a response to a stimulus. Growth response to light is regulated by <b>auxin</b>, a plant hormone found in the plant's stem tip and roots.</p><p>There are two types of tropisms that plants can experience.</p>
                <ul><li><b>Phototropism</b> causes plants to grown in reaction to light to maximize exposure to light for photosynthesis</li>
                <li><b>Geotropism</b> causes plants to grow in reaction to gravity to help the plant find maximum moisture or light</li></ul>
                <br><h4>History in the Branches</h4>
                <p>Why do some trees in Harvard Forest have branches on its lower trunk and others do not? The answer is found in phototropism.</p>
                <p>Long-lived trees with many lower branches reaching out in all directions are characteristic of <b>open-grown</b> trees. Open-grown trees grew in open field conditions with a lot of sunlight and little surrounding trees that would produce shade. <b>Forest-grown</b> trees have very minimal lower branches or lower branches that are dead and broken. Forest-grown trees grew in dense conditions where there is little room to grow horizontally and where each tree is competing with the others for light.</p>

                <p>This mysterious stonework dams the water flow of the stream that passes through it. The sluice inside the dam completely blocks the water, allowing it to only flow in-between the stones. The water flow passing through the dam is not strong enough to run a mill, even if the forest cover is removed. It may be a bridge, but there are other bridges built nearby that are also crossing over the stream.</p>

                <br><h4>Ephemeral and Important</h4>
                <p>Vernal pools are temporary wetland habitats. They undergo a wet-dry cycle of filling with water from precipitation in the autumn or winter and drying up in the summer. The wet-dry cycle is important for amphibian and invertebrate reproduction, because the cycle prevents fish from living in the pools and predating on the other animals.</p>
                <br><h4>Life in a Pool</h4>
                <p>There are two groups of animals that use vernal pools. <b>Obligate</b> or <b>direct indicator</b> species rely completely on vernal pools to continue their life cycle. <b>Facultative</b> or <b>indirect indicator</b> species have adaptations to use vernal pools in their lifespans, but also can use other wetland habitats.</p>
                <p> Some obligate species common to vernal pools in Harvard Forest and in Massachusetts are the wood frog, the spadefoot toad, four species of mole salamander (spotted salamander, blue-spotted salamander, Jefferson salamander, and the marbled salamander), and two species of fairy shrimp. Some facultative species include other frogs, reptiles, insect larvae, fingernail clams, amphibious snails, and leeches.</p>

At least 85 species of North American birds (including songbirds and owls) excavate or use cavities in snags. Many of these species are in decline due to decreased habitat.</p>

                <br><h4>The More Snags, the Better</h4>
                <p> Snags are more abundant in <b>old growth</b> structure. Old growth forests are forests that were never altered directly by humans through logging. The forest canopies and floors are diverse in age and structure. Dead and wind-fallen trees decompose slowly. They are important ecosystems and the habitat of many species of animals and plants, some of which can only survive in old growth conditions. Today only about <b>0.2%</b> of New England's forests are considered to be old growth.</p>
                <p> Compare this to <b>second growth</b> forests, which are forests that grew back after human land use. Harvard Forest, like most New England Forests, are second growth forests because of a history of European settlement, forest harvest, and agriculture.</p>

                <p>Our trail intersects with a trail owned by the Feldman family, who over 2 generations have transformed their acres of land into miles of recreational trails open to respectful use by the public. They are careful stewards of their woods and work closely with a forester to harvest trees and diversify wildlife habitat. An ongoing partnership with Mount Grace Land Conservation Trust has enabled them to establish a conservation restriction on much of the property, protecting their forest in perpetuity for the generations that will follow.</p>

                <p>Some trees around Harvard Forest are marked with metal circles, tape, or metal dendrometer bands for various research projects conducted by our Harvard Forest researchers.</p>
                <p>Dendrometer bands are useful for measuring the radius of trees. Over time, the spring expands as the radius of the growing tree expands.</p>
                <p>Other tape or circular tags are used for broad and long-term studies. One example of such research are the trees with pink tape and initials "MEF" are from a graduate student's project. She took one-time samples of stemwood core, root core, and branch from each tree to analyze tree carbon and how trees respond to biotic and abiotic stresses due to climate change.</p>
                <p>Harvard Forest is part of broader long-term research on ecology across the nation. Researchers therefore need to mark trees to track them over years and decades.</p>

                <p><b>Scientific name: <i>Acer pensylvanicum</i></b></p>
                <p>Striped maple is an understory species also called goosefoot maple. Striped maple trees have greenish, striped bark because of chloroplasts in their trunks. Even when their leaves fall off, the trees can continue photosynthesizing light throughout the winter.</p>
                <p>Striped maple is delicious to animals. Porcupines, cottontails, beaver, deer, and moose browse the bark and young shoots, which is why is is sometimes called moosefoot maple.</p>
                <p>Did you know striped maple trees can change gender? Striped maple trees can be male or female depending on whether their flowers are all female or all male. Environmental cues may trigger a sex change to favor conditions that will promote better health, longevity, and fitness.

Wintergreen leaves have alternating, waxy leaves that smell like minty wintergreen when crushed or ripped. Wintergreen and partrigeberry leaves do not fall off in the winter, so look out for their green leaves against the white snow.</p> <p>They also have distinctive white flowers.

                <p><b>Hobblebush</b> (<i>Viburnum lantanoides</i>) is a shrub found at waist-height. Hobblebushes are named because their branches--which can grow to four feet or longer in length--sometimes bend and take root, tripping and causing unsuspecting hikers to hobble.</p>
                <p>Hobblebush flowers have fragrant flowers that grow in groups. There are smaller clusters of flowers in the middle of a group with larger flowers around the outside. Their flowers become berries from summer to fall, and the berries change in color over the seasons from green to red until they become black. The leaves also gradually darken to red or purple in autumn.</p>

                <p>Chestnut trees are notable for the very prominent, coarse teeth on their leaves. Their leaves are very long with reddish stems, and turn yellow early in the fall. To identify adult chestnut trees, also look for large, dangling white or greenish catkins.</p>
                <p>As long as the chestnut's root system remains intact, the tree can sprout up if killed above the roots. While a chestnut tree may appear to be a sapling with multiple stems, the root network may be hundreds of years old.</p>

                <br><p>The <b>chestnut blight</b>, caused by a fungi <i>Cryphonectria parasitica</i> was introduced to North America in the early 1900s from Asia. Unlike Japanese and Chinese chestnut trees, American chestnut trees have never encountered this fungi before and do not have the adaptations to defend against the fungi, and were wiped out across the United States. What was once an important food source for both wildlife and people is rendered a ghost.</p>
                <p>Chestnut blight causes cankers and yellow-orange spore tendrils (conidia) along branches and the trunk.</p>
                <p>Researchers come to Harvard Forest to keep track of the remaining American chestnut trees that grow here. Currently, research around the United States is being conducted to stop the chestnut blight. Some methods to control the blight include a breeding program to cross chestnut species for fungi resistance, a transgenic program to give the chestnut genes for resistance, and the importation a parasite to control the fungi itself.</p>

                <br><h4>Plantations and the Field of Forestry</h4>
                <p>Plantations of a single type of tree were common between the late 1920s and 2007. Forestry researchers of Harvard Forest planted stands of a single species, usually a non-native conifer. The data gathered was useful to understand a species' characteristics and suitability in the New England climate.</p>
                <p>After careful planning on future land management, Harvard Forest started logging plantations in 2007 to restore the diversity of native species. We are now researching how native populations impact forest growth in early successional habitats like the former red pine plantation in Stop 5.</p>

                <p><b>Fire scars</b>, upside-down "V" shapes at the base of the trunks of trees, are reminders of a 1957 forest fire. The fire burned through 78 acres of Harvard Forest and a large amount of land on neighboring properties. This stop is the eastern edge of the fire, which spread until it reached the Black Gum Swamp nearby.</p>

                <hr><br><h4>The Making of Fire Scars</h4>
                <p>Nonlethal fires usually hurt trees the most at their base on the uphill side of trees where flammable leaves, twigs, and branches concentrate the heat. The concentrated "hotspot" of fire burns through tree bark and kill the tree's living tissue. As a result, the tree is left with the "V"-shaped scar where new tissue cannot grow.</p>
                <p>Since the tree is still alive, it continues to grow and expand in diameter everywhere except the site of the fire scar. The new growth of bark from the living cells of the tree rounds out the edges of the fire scar and eventually grows over the site of the dead fire scar tissue. Looking at a cross-section of a tree will reveal the fire scars on trees whose fire scars have been completely covered by living tissue as the tree grows. It's possible to use these fire scars to date the year of a fire.</p>

                <br><h4>Forest Giants</h4>
                <p><b>Scientific name: <i>Tsuga canadensis</i></b></p>
                <p>Hemlock trees have dense, shady canopies. In the winter, they house deer and migrating warblers. As a <b>foundation species</b>, hemlocks are important to shaping the ecosystem of the forest. Harvard Forest researchers continue to study hemlock trees and their interactions with the atmosphere, water, and with other organisms.</p>
                <p>Before European settlement, hemlocks were one of the dominant species of trees in old growth forests. They were valued for their tannin, which is useful for tanning leather. Today, hemlocks comprise one-fourth of Massachusetts forests.</p>
                <p>(See Stop 3, Leaf 8 for more information about hemlock identification)</p>

                <br><p>Hemlocks are threatened in New England because of an invasive species. The <b>hemlock woolly adelgid</b> (<i>Adelges tsugae</i>), an aphid-like insect, feeds on the sap of hemlock shoots, weakening or killing the plant. The insect was accidentally introduced to the northeastern part of the United States in the 1950s. In 2002, it came to Harvard Forest and has killed many hemlock trees since. As of 2015, 90% of North America's eastern hemlocks have been affected by the hemlock woolly adelgid.</p>
                <p>Woolly adelgids are given their name because of their egg sacs, which are cotton-like in appearance. Walking around Harvard Forest, you may find them underneath the needles of hemlock trees.</p>
                <p>The woolly adelgid is considered an <b>invasive species</b> because it is not native to the area it's living in, North America. Hemlock woolly adelgids are not considered an invasive species in Asia because Chinese hemlocks have evolved a resistance to the insect over time of living in the same habitat. In the eastern United States where hemlocks do not have the same adaptations and hemlock woolly adelgids do not have natural predators, the insects have caused severe environmental damage that alters native ecosystems.</p>

                <p>Sites of Harvard Forest with hemlock groves are being used for long-term research. The <b>Hemlock Removal Experiment</b>, started in 2005, researches the impact of hemlocks as a foundational species on the forest community. By removing hemlocks in a hemlock-dominated stand, researchers can simulate the effects of the hemlock woolly adelgid, model the data, and compare the findings to current adelgid-infested forests.

                <br><h4>Glaciers to Gum Trees</h4>
                <p>The Black Gum Swamp was formed from a glacial meltwater pond 12500 years B.P. (Before Present). Today, many woody plants, ferns, and moss thrive in the swamp. The types of vegetation you see in it today are almost the same as they were 8000 years ago.</p>
                <p>The name of Black Gum Swamp comes from the black gum trees that live in the swamp. Look around you and you will see some black gum trees that are over 300 years old.</p>

                <br><h4>Using Paleoecology to Study the Swamp's History</h4>
                <p><b>Paleoecology</b> is the study of the interactions between the environment and organisms in the geological past. Black Gum Swamp is a great area to study paleoecology because we can study the material in the soil to learn about past environmental conditions.</p>
                <p>Did you know researchers have used Black Gum Swamp to look at past climate conditions? <b>Sediment cores</b> extracted from Black Gum Swamp were studied layer by layer, a few centimeters at a time. A sediment core is a vertical column sampling of the soil. The bottommost layers of soil in the column are from the most distant past (because they were deposited first) and the top layers of soil are from the recent past (because they were deposited last). 
                <p>By looking at pollen grains among the decomposed organic material, Harvard Forest researchers can determine when the climate was warmer or cooler compared to other points in geologic time. If we see more pollen from <i>Picea</i>, a genus of spruce, in one of the layers compared to its adjacent layers, we can infer that there was a climate reversal from a cooler to warmer climate between the layer with the pollen and the layer underneath it. To find out how long ago the climate reversal happened, we can use <b>radiocarbon dating</b> techniques to measure the radioactive decay of the carbon in that layer of soil.</p>

                <br><p><b>Scientific name: <i>Nyssa sylvatica</i></b></p>
                <p><b>Black gum trees</b> or <b>tupelo trees</b> are the oldest trees in Black Gum Swamp and the oldest trees in the Northeast. The tree you are looking at is the oldest living tree at Harvard Forest at 420 years old. Black gum trees can live hundreds of years thanks to their very hard, heavy wood that can survive strong wind conditions that other trees cannot. Interlocking grains in the wood prevent it from being split, making the tree unfavorable for logging.
                <p>Black gum trees are also called beetlebung trees because their wood was used during colonial times to make mallet heads ("beetles") and barrel stoppers ("bungs")</p>
                <p>You can easily spot a black gum tree by its alligator skin-like bark and branches that bend at 90-degree angles. Visit the Black Gum Swamp in autumn and witness a spectacle of scarlet leaves hanging from the tree.</p>

                <hr><br><h4>Measuring a Tree's Age</h4>
                <p>We can learn about a tree's age through <b>dendrochronology</b>, the study of <b>tree rings</b>. Tree rings are composed of xylem, a type of cell that carries water up through the plant.</p>
                <p>A tree doesn't need to be cut down before you can find out its age. Harvard Forest researchers use tree coring tools called <b>borers</b> that screw into a tree and remove a sample of the tree about a pencil-width thick and as long as the radius of the tree's trunk. The tree core allows researchers to see all of the rings and learn the tree's age and how the tree grew.
