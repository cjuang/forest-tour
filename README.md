Harvard Forest French Road Trail: The Virtual Tour

This is the code for an online virtual tour of Harvard Forest's newest trail, the French Road Trail.
The purpose of the virtual tour is to engage an online audience and connect them with historical and scientific
information from Harvard Forest they would not get just by walking the trail. The virtual tour is the culmination
of my project as a Harvard OCS Arts and Museums Fellows Program Intern.
